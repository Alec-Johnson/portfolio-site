Only when we have learnt more about the target users, we can create a website that has the features/design that is more suitable to their needs.

					'This project requires an  authentication system to allow users to create an account, login, logout, create communities, upload images, and interact with posts. It utilizes JWT tokens to authenticate users inside a custom middleware, which I can then use to set up guards on protected routes. This is an example from the "sub" route which I will explain. When uploading an image to a sub banner/graphic, we want to check if there is a user inside our response object, check if a user is authenticated, and then check whether they own the subreddit before making a POST request to the server. Compared to the route above, we do not implement any middleware as we want to allow everyone to make a search.',

				description:
					"TailwindCSS makes toggling between dark/light mode very straightforward. To make things even easier, I added a library called to handle theme switching and keeping the state consistent between pages and refreshes. This works by adding a theme property to the page and storing the users preference inside local storage. On a deeper level, next-themes works by injecting a script into the site Head which will grab the stored property in local storage or set the preferred color scheme by the client. I was made aware of this when my compilier was throwing an error that Next.js prefers to use their <Script /> component inside of <head>.",

					"I wanted to implement dynamic loading of posts just like the official Reddit website. This helps decrease inital load time and reduce the number of requests made to the server, which in turn saves money. The first step was to add the pagination functionality to the API inside the post route, and then implement an obersever to detect when the bottom of the page was reached in the front end using the IntersectionObserver API. I then made use of useSWRInfinite to make requests to the server when that page was reached.",

				title: "Dynamic Routing",

				description:
					'Following the concept of a "reddit clone", I needed dynamic routes to be created for subs, posts, and user profiles. Their routing pattern for a post is  "reddit.com/r/:subName/:postIdentifier/:slug". The identifier and slug need to be generated as soon as a post is made so it can be stored in the database with those corresponding values. TypeORM\'s @BeforeInsert decorator is one solution as I can pass in these helper functions to generate what is needed before the data is stored. I found some helper functions on StackOverflow that I changed to fit mold of a 7 character identifier and a slug containing the post title, seperating each word with an _.',
